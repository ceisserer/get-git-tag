# get-git-tag

This action gets tag name from commit that triggered the action and puts it into an environment variable GIT_TAG_NAME.  It will also export it as an output named "tag".

You can also use optional parameters `tagRegex` and `tagRegexGroup` to extract a part from tag string.

## FAQ

### Can you offer a major version tag/branch alias?  I want automatic updates!

Nope!  This was always weird/bad pattern of github actions and I don't have time to maintain or automate that.  Luckily github offers a solution for this.  Create a `.github/dependabot.yml` with, at a minimum, the following config:

```yaml
# Basic dependabot.yml file with
# minimum configuration for two package managers

version: 2
updates:
  # Enable version updates for npm
  # Enable updates to github actions
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
```

Furthermore, this action won't be changing much.
